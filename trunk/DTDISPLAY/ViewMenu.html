<H3>dtdisplay on-line help</H3>
<H1>View menu</H1>

Commands in the View menu are quick ways to change what is viewed in the image 
display area.
<dl>
<dt>Refresh
<dd>	This refreshes the image display area by remapping from image pixel values to the 
color scale and displaying the result.

<dt>Zoom...
<dd>	This does no zooming, but pops up a message box describing how to zoom by 
dragging out a zoom box with the middle mouse button.  The message box serves as a 
reminder of the not-so-apparent function of the middle mouse button.  If you zoom
large enough, then the actual pixel values are superimposed on the image.

<dt>Unzoom
<dd>	This unzooms a zoomed image and refreshes an unzoomed image.  You can also 
unzoom an image by double-clicking on it with the middle mouse button.

<dt>Pan...
<dd>	This does no panning, put pops up a message box describing how to 
pan by dragging across a zoomed image with BOTH the left and middle mouse buttons pressed
The message box serves as a reminder of the not-so-apparent function of the middle mouse button.

<dt>Image header...
<dd>	This displays a new window with the image header in it.  You cannot save any 
edits made to the image header.

<dt>Calculated reflections
<dt>Observed reflections
<dd>	These toggle buttons select whether any available reflection list is displayed or not.  
Only Observed works for now.  Load a reflection list with the Load refln list command in the File menu.

<dt>Resolution arcs
<dd>	This displays isoresolution circles or arcs on the image.  Up to 5 arcs
are displayed.  To determine the resolution of any given arc, simply click on
it and view the resolution in the scrolled output window in the upper left of
the dtdisplay window.

<dt>Measure
<dd>	This selects whether the crystallographic d-spacing in Ångstroms between the last 
two selected pixels is calculated and displayed in the scrolled text output area.  The 
detector position and spatial distortion as well as the source wavelength are required to 
calculate the d-spacing.  If they are unavailable, then the d-spacing is not calculated.
