Choose Refln View Props... in the Edit menu to display a dialog box with the current

most cases the values set in this dialog do not take effect until either the OK or Apply 
button is selected.  Also, if no image is currently displayed, then settings made in this 
dialog box have no effect.  Selecting Help activates the HTML viewer for on-line help.
