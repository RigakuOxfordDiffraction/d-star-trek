<H1>dtdisplay on-line help: Getting Started</H1>
When you collect and process single crystal diffraction images from a position-sensitive 
detector, it is very useful to visualize or see the images.  You want to check that the 
crystal diffracts and that the Bragg peaks can be integrated.  The suitability of a crystal for 
further data collection and analysis depends on a number of factors and compromises.  
Among these factors are:
<UL>
<LI>crystal unit cell
<LI>  spot shape (no split peaks or satellites)
<LI>  diffraction limit
<LI>  spot separation
<LI>  exposure time
<LI>  rotation angle increment
<LI>  detector position
</UL>

For example, if the unit cell lengths are large, then the diffraction spots will be spaced 
close together and the detector will have to be moved further from the crystal.  Often only 
by viewing images can you judge whether or not you should collect diffraction data from a 
crystal.  The <b>dtdisplay</b> program displays images and allows you to decide whether to 
proceed.
<P>
<B>dtdisplay</B> uses a color X Window display and the OSF/Motif widget set and style.  Both 
X and OSF/Motif are widely used on workstations, so you may already by familiar with 
them and consequently already know how to run and use <b>dtdisplay</b>.  If you are not 
familiar, do not worry as <b>dtdisplay</b> is very easy to use and comes with many help features.  
Before you start <b>dtdisplay</b> be sure your DISPLAY environment variable is set to your 
current display and the <tt>Dtdisplay</tt> application defaults file is accessible to your X server.  
The latter file can be placed in the system-wide application defaults directory (e.g. 
<tt>usr/lib/X11/app-defaults</tt>) or in your home directory.  Please consult the installation 
guide in section 5 and your system manager.


<H4>Running dtdisplay</h4>

After <b>dtdisplay</b> has been installed and placed in your PATH, just enter <tt>dtdisplay</tt> along 
wiith an optional image filename to run it.   Since <b>dtdisplay</b> is an X Window program the 
standard X command line options are also supported.  Messages are written to stdout and 
stderr as required. The syntax for running <b>dtdisplay</b> is simply:
<p>
<tt>dtdisplay [image_file]</tt>
<p>
Remember, the image filename after the <tt>dtdisplay</tt> command is optional.
