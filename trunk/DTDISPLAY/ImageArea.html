Help for dtdisplay: Image area controls
</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>

<H3>dtdisplay on-line help</H3>
<H1>Image area controls</H1>

dtdisplay has two image display areas, a large one on the right and a small one in the 
lower left of the main window.  A few commands work in both 
display areas, while other commands only work in the large display area.
<dl>
<dt>Left mouse button pressed down
<dd>	If you press and hold the left mouse button down in an image display area, the 
image pixel coordinates and pixel value are displayed in the upper left or upper right of the 
display area.  As you move the mouse pointer with the left mouse button held down, the 
information is updated.  This is the fastest way to see pixel values.  This works in both the 
large and small image display areas.  If the Image border fraction is less than 1, then
line profiles through the displayed portion of the image are drawn on the right and bottom
sides.

<dt>Left mouse button released
<dd>	When you release the left mouse button in the large image display area, this selects 
the pixel under the mouse pointer.  Information about the pixel is displayed in the scrolled 
text output area and usually includes pixel coordinate, pixel value, resolution, etc (see 
above).  Furthermore, the small image display area shows a zoomed region around the 
selected pixel.

<dt>Middle mouse button
<dd>	Use the middle mouse button to select a rectangle to zoom in on.  When you press 
and hold down the middle mouse button a rectangle appears that indicates the area to be 
zoomed.  Drag the mouse pointer to change the size of the rectangle.  Releasing the 
middle mouse button displays the zoomed area.  Double-clicking the middle mouse 
unzooms the image or refreshes an unzoomed image.  If the zoom box is within a single 
pixel, this also unzooms the image.  If you zoom large enough, the actual pixel values are 
displayed within the pixels.  The middle mouse button works in both the large and small 
image display areas.  (SCROLL LOCK MUST BE OFF!)
<dt>Middle FIRST, then left mouse button pressed down
<dd>This allows you to pan or move the zoom box around before actually zooming.
Release the left mouse button to continue to change the size of the zoomed area.

<dt>Left FIRST, then middle mouse button pressed down
<dd>	If you press and hold the left mouse button down in an image display area, then 
press and hold the middle mouse button down, you can pan around a zoomed image by dragging
the mouse around.

<dt>Right mouse button
<dd>	The right mouse button currently has no function.  Perhaps in the future it will 
pop-up a menu.

<dt>Changing the color scale
<dd>If the Image border fraction is less than 1, then a color scale control pops-up
when the left mouse button is pressed when the cursor is in the line profile area along 
the bottom of the image area.  You can change the minimum scale value or the maximum
scale value by grabbing the end of the arrow and moving it left or right.  Values for the
displayed image 
are updated only when the left mouse button is released in the bottom line profile area.  To
cancel any impending changes, move the cursor outside of the bottom line profile area
and release the left mouse button.  The color scale has marks for 3 values:  the image average
is a solid vertical line, 1.5 sigma below the average is an ascending half line to the left of the
average (it may be off scale), 5 sigma above the average is a descending half line to the right of
the average (it may be off scale).

<dt>Keyboard commands in the image areas
<dd>	If the keyboard focus is in the large or small image area, then a few keyboard 
commands can be used.  One way to set the keyboard focus in the small image area is to 
click on the Scan No. text field, then press the Tab key.  To set the keyboard focus to the 
large image area, select the scrolled text area, then press Ctrl+Tab.  Keyboard commands 
are:
<dl>
<dt>>, G, <, L 
<dd>	These zoom (>, G) or unzoom (<, L) the displayed image by a factor of 2.

<dt>I, J, K, M. arrow keys
<dd>	These shift or pan the view.  The shift is one-tenth of the viewed area or 1 pixel, 
whichever is larger.
