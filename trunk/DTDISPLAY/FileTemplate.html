Help for dtdisplay: File Template Dialog

<H1>File Template Dialog</H1>

The File Template dialog selects a single image or a series of images from a scan
for use with the Open, Overlay, Tile, Underlay, Average, Statistics, 
Prev, Next and No. commands.  In general, both the title to the selection dialog and
the "OK" button label change to reflect the current use of the selection dialog.

<dl>
<dt>Filter or template
<dd>This specifies the filename template.  Files which match this template are
listed in the Files field.
It is important that the template contains question marks, if the template is to be
used by Tile, Overlay, Underlay, Average, etc.
<dt>Directories
<dd>Shows the current directory name and immediate directory tree.  Select a new directory 
by double-clicking on a directory here.
<dt>Files
<dd>Shows the files in the selected directory which match the Filter or Template.  Double-click
on a file to select it.
<dt>Seq start
<dd>The starting or first sequence number to be used in conjunction with the Template.
<dt>Seq incr
<dd>The increment between images.  This value will be added to 
the starting sequence number to get the second image number.  It may be
negative to decrement the sequence number.
<dt>Num images
<dd>The number of images to use in any Tile, Overlay, Average or Statistics operation.
<dt>Image file
<dd>Select the filename to open or save as.  This control is missing for Tile, Underlay,
Overlay, and Average operations, since a series of filenames is constructed from the Template,
Seq start, Seq incr and Num images controls.
</dl>
<b>Examples</b>
<p>
Below are three examples.  In each case the template, the starting sequence
number, the increment and number of images are given on one line and the resulting
image filenames are listing on subsequent lines.
