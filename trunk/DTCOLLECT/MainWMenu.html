<H1><b>dtcollect</b> on-line help: Main Window Menubar</H1>

<p><b>File menu</b>

<p>The File menu is used to initialize or re-initialize the hardware devices.
The commands in the file menu are Initialize and Exit.

<dl>
<dt>Initialize
<dd>	The Initialize command popups a menu with the following choices:
<ul>
<li>	Crystal goniometer	Call initialize routine of the crystal goniometer
<li>	Detector goniometer	Call initialize routine of the detector goniometer
<li>	Detector		Call detector initialize routine
<li>	Shutter		Call shutter initialize routine
<li>	Sensors		Call sensors (counters) initialize routine
<li>	Source			Call source device initialize routine
<li>	All			Call all the hardware device initialize routines
</ul>
<blockquote>
Each of these calls the initialize routine of the respective hardware device.  These routines 
in turn are site and installation dependent.
<blockquote>
<dt>Image template...
<dd>This command is obsolete.  Use the Scan Template ... button in the main window instead.
This lets you view and edit the current settings for the image filename 
template and sequence numbers.  The <a=ImageFileSelect.html>image file selection</A> template dialog box appears as 
shown elsewhere.  The settings in the dialog box come from the header of the last 
image read in or from the last time the image template dialog appeared.  The template is 
set from the top field, NOT the selected filename.  The template should contain question 
mark characters to be used by d*TREK functions.

 
<dt>Exit
<dd>	This command exits from dtcollect.
</dl>

<p><b>Edit menu</b>

<p>The edit menu has commands to display dialog boxes that let you edit the some information
that will appear in image header and to clear the output scrolled text window.

<dl>
<dt>Image header items...
<dd>This is currently not implemented.  It pop-ups an unusable dialog box.  Select Cancel or
Dismiss in this box to dismiss it.
<dt>Clear output
<dd>You can clear the output scrolled text window with this item.  You have two choices, either
clear all the text or only selected text.  To clear selected text, first select the text to clear,
then press Edit/Clear output/Selected text.
</dl>

<p><b>View menu</b>
<p>
Commands in the View menu are all desensitized.
This menu has no active commands as of now.

<dl>
<dt>Image header...
<dd>
Use the <b>dtdisplay</b> to view image headers.
</dl>

<p><b>Collect menu</b>
<p>The Collect menu provides a way to collect more complicated scans with the <b>dtcollect</b> 
program.  Presently, only one choice is implemented: Scan...

<dl>
<dt>Scan ...
<dd>
This pop-ups the scan dialog where you can create, edit and save scans.  You can also 
collect a single scan or multiple scans with the scan dialog.  See <a Href=ScanHelpHTML.html>Scan...</A>
for details.
</dl>

<p><b>Help menu</b>
<p>This help menu provides access to the hyper-text markup language viewer.  
Context-sensitive help is provided in the main window title whenever a button is armed.  (In Motif 
version 1.2, the title will also provided help on text fields when they gain keyboard focus.)

<dl>
<dt>Help via the HTML viewer
<dd>
Select this command to activate a hyper-text markup language (HTML) viewer to 
view the dtcollect HTML help files.  The default HTML viewer is NCSA Mosaic, but this 
may be changed in the resource file.  If the viewer is already running in the process tree, 
then it is used, otherwise a new process is created that runs the viewer.
</dl>
