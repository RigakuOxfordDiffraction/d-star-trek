<H1>Wavelength chooser dialog</H1>

The Wavelength chooser dialog selects a wavelength to perform data collection
at.  You can select an absolute wavelength or scan across an absorption edge 
and select a point from the scan.

<dl>
<dt>Common wavelengths
<dd>This is a list of wavelengths that have been specified in the resource file.
You can select a wavelength by clicking on it.
In the resource file, the resource is *cUIwavelength*listItems and the wavelengths are specified as a single string with wavelength separated by a colon as in:
<p>*cUIwavelength*listItems:  1.54178 Cu Kalpha:0.71069 Mo
<p>Note the wavelength may be followed by an optional comment.
<dt>Option
<dd>This selects the option or method of designating the wavelength.
<dl>
<dt>Absolute
<dd>Move to the wavelength absolutely.
<dt>Peak
<dd>Scan near the selected wavelength and move to the peak position.  Check with
your data collection manager to see if this option works on your system since
it requires special coding for your hardware.
<dt>Midpoint
<dd>Scan near the selected wavelength and move to the inflection point.
Check with
your data collection manager to see if this option works on your system since
it requires special coding for your hardware.
</dl>
<dt>Optimize
<dd>Select whether to optimize intensity through the collimator after moving
to the selected wavelength or not. Check with
your data collection manager to see if this option works on your system since
it requires special coding for your hardware.
<dt>Wavelength
<dd>You may enter any allowed wavelength desired here instead of using the
list selection mechanism.  Any number greater than 100 will assumed to be in 
electron volts (eV), while one less than or equal to 100 will assumed to be 
in Ångstroms.
