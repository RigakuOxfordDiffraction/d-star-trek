<H3>dtcollect on-line help</H3>
<H1>Edit header items dialog</H1>

With the Edit header items dialog you can enter the crystal properties
and direct beam position into the current header.

<p> 
<dl>
<dt>Unit cell
<dd>Enter the three unit cell lengths a, b, c in Ångstroms and the three
unit cell angles in degrees.  Normally these values are initially determined and
set automatically by dtindex.  They are refined by dtrefine.
<dt>Orientation
<dd>Enter the three crystal orientation angles in degrees.  Normally these values are
initially determined by dtindex and refined by dtrefine.
<dt>Mosaicity
<dd>Enter the crystal mosaicity in degrees.  This is the full width at the background level for a reflection in the rocking angle direction.  The crystal 
mosaicity is automatically determined by dtrefine if given a reflection
list from a 3D dtfind run.
The mosaicity can also be estimated visually by setting trial values and
using dtpredict and dtdisplay.
<dt>Spacegroup
<dd>Enter the crystal spacegroup number from the International Tables.
Normally this is partly determined by dtindex.
The ... chooser control is not active now.
<dt>Description
<dd>Enter a crystal description for your notes.
<dt>Direct beam (px)
<dd>Enter the direct beam position in pixels when the detector is not rotated.  The
direct beam position can be selected with dtdisplay and pasted here. 
<dt>Comment
<dd>Enter a general comment that will appear in all headers.  Use this
field to describe the experiment.
