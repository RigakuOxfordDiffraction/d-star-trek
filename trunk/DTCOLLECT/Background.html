<H1><b>dtcollect</b> on-line help: Background</H1>

In order to collect single crystal diffraction images from a position-sensitive detector,  you 
need a program that controls the shutter, the goniometers and detector (i.e. a 
diffractometer).  You want to collect preliminary images to check that the crystal diffracts 
and that the Bragg peaks can be integrated.   This is further discussed in the <A HREF=dtdisplay.html><B>dtdisplay</b></A>
documentation.  <b>dtcollect</b> does the actual data acquisition by controlling the diffractometer hardware.


<H4>Running <b>dtcollect</b></h4>
<P>
After <b>dtcollect</b> has been installed and placed in your PATH, just enter <b>dtcollect</b> along 
wiith an optional image filename to run it.   Since <b>dtcollect</b> is an X Window program the 
standard X command line options are also supported.  Messages are written to stdout and 
stderr as required. The syntax for running <b>dtcollect</b> is simply:

<b>dtcollect</b>

The <b>dtcollect</b> main window shown later will appear on the display.  The 
main features of the window are a title, a menu bar with some command buttons, a shutter 
control panel, an expose control panel, a scan control panel, 
two goniometer control panels for the crystal and 
detector, a source wavelength control panel, and a scrolled text 
output region.  Each of these features is discussed in following sections, but first a word 
about how to get help within <b>dtcollect</b>.

Getting help

<p>The <A HREF=MainW.html>main window</A> title is usually supplied by the window manager.  <b>dtcollect</b> changes the 
title in response to user input.  When the mouse is used to arm a 
button, the title is changed to show what that button does.  If you use Motif 1.2, when 
you click in a text 
field or tab to it, the title is changed to show what the text field is used for.  In this way, 
you can receive continuous context-sensitive help.  If you ever have a question about what 
a button does, move the mouse pointer over the button, then press and hold down the 
mouse button.  The title will show what the function of the button is.  To activate the 
function, simply release the mouse button.  Do not release the mouse button with the 
pointer in the button unless you want to activate the function.  To avoid activating the 
function, move the mouse pointer off the button, then release the mouse button.  To see 
what a text field does, simply click in it and read the help line in the window title.  You 
can also customize the help lines.  More extensive help can be viewed by 
selecting the HTML Help Viewer command from the Help menu.
