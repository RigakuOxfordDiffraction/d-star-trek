for a  series of images from a scan.  Enter a template or filter that contains
question marks in the top text field of the dialog.  Select Filter to see
files that match the template.

<dl>
<dt>Starting seq. number
<dd>The starting or first sequence number 
<dt>Increment
<dd>The increment between images.  This value will be added to 
the starting sequence number to get the second image number.  It may be
negative to decrement the sequence number.
<dt>Number of images
<dd>The number of images to use in operations like Tile, Overlay, Average or Statistics.

<b>Examples</b>

image filenames are listing on subsequent lines.
