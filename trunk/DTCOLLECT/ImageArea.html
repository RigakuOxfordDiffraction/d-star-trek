<H3>dtcollect on-line help</H3>
<H1>Image Area controls</H1>

dtcollect has a single image display area on the right-hand side of the main window.
Next are descriptions of mouse and keyboards commands that interact with the image display.
<dl>
<dt>Left mouse button pressed down
<dd>	If you press and hold the left mouse button down in the image display area, the 
image pixel coordinates and pixel value are displayed in the upper left or upper right of the 
display area.  As you move the mouse pointer with the left mouse button held down, the 
information is updated.  This is the fastest way to see pixel values.

<dt>Left mouse button released
<dd>	When you release the left mouse button in the image display area, this selects 
the pixel under the mouse pointer.  Information about the pixel is displayed in the scrolled 
text output area and usually includes pixel coordinate, pixel value, resolution, etc (see 
above).

<dt>Middle mouse button
<dd>	Use the middle mouse button to select a rectangle to zoom in on.  When you press 
and hold down the middle mouse button a rectangle appears that indicates the area to be 
zoomed.  Drag the mouse pointer to change the size of the rectangle.  Releasing the 
middle mouse button displays the zoomed area.  Double-clicking the middle mouse 
unzooms the image or refreshes an unzoomed image.  If the zoom box is within a single 
pixel, this also unzooms the image.  If you zoom large enough, the actual pixel values are 
displayed within the pixels.

<dt>Right mouse button
<dd>	The right mouse button currently has no function.  Perhaps in the future it will 
pop-up a menu.

<dt>Keyboard commands in the image areas
<dd>	If the keyboard focus is in the image area, then a few keyboard 
commands can be used.  Keyboard commands 
are:
<dl>
<dt>>, G, <, L 
<dd>	These zoom (>, G) or unzoom (<, L) the displayed image by a factor of 2.

<dt>I, J, K, M. arrow keys
<dd>	These shift or pan the view.  The shift is one-tenth of the viewed area or 1 pixel, 
whichever is larger.
