With the Edit detector items dialog you can enter the detector modes
for data collection.

<p> 
<dl>
<dt>Binning mode
<dd>Select the mode for binning pixels during detector readout.
<dl>
<dt>1x1
<dd>In 1x1 mode, no binning is done.  The full pixel resolution of the detector is used.
<dt>2x2
<dd>In 2x2 mode, 4 pixels (2 in each direction) are binned during readout.  Images are 1/4 the normal size.
</dl>
<dt>Readout speed
<dd>Select the detector readout speed.
<dl>
<dt>Slow
<dd>In slow mode, the detector readout takes about 9 seconds and introduces the lowest noise.
<dt>Fast
<dd>In fast mode, the detector readout takes about 3 seconds, but introduces
more noise than slow readout mode.
</dl>
<dt>Dezinger mode
<dd>Select the image dezinger mode
<dl>
<dt>Normal
<dd>In normal dezinger mode, each small rotation increment is exposed twice.
The two images are compared to remove cosmic rays and radioactive decay events.
<dt>None
<dd>In none dezinger mode, dezinger is not used.  Each small rotation
increment is exposed just once.
