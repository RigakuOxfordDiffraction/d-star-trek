#summary How to build d*TREK

= Introduction =

The d*TREK command line programs are built from the command line using make.  Depending on the operating system, there are specific makefiles that should be used; generally these are named Makefile.$os, where $os is the name of the operating system (Makefile.linux for Linux, etc).


= Linux =

Building the command line programs on Linux is a two step process:
  * In the DTDISPLAY subdirectory, run the command
    {{{
       make -f Makefile.linux lib
    }}}
  * In the DTTREK subdirectory, run the command
    {{{
       make -f Makefile.linux
    }}}
